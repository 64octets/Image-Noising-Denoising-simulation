# Image-Noising-Denoising-simulation
The goal of this simulation is to try some of the basic methods of the image processing. We are using the images duck.jpg, puppy.jpg, wrenches.jpg and matlab.jpg for our tests (folder "images"). Main tests: reduce the quantization level, downsampling, add white gausian and salt & pepper noise and then try to remove it by using filters, use non linear based on mean value filters, use custom filters, make the image black and white using thresholds and seperate images in red, green and blue components. For the implementation we used Matlab R2015a in Windows 10.
